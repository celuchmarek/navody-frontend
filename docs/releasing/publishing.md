# Steps you must complete before you release a new version of GOV.UK Frontend

1. Raise new issues in the team GitHub repositories ([govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend), [govuk-frontend-docs](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend-docs), [govuk-prototype-kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit)) to:
  - create release notes for the new release (example card: [#1986](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1986))
  - create release notes for the new version of GOV.UK Prototype Kit (example card: [#958](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/issues/958))
  - create a card for the new release of GOV.UK Frontend (example card: [#1987](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1987))
  - update the GOV.UK Design System to use the new release of GOV.UK Frontend (example card: [#1347](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/issues/1347))
  - create a card for the new release of GOV.UK Prototype Kit (example card: [#917](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/issues/917))
  - update the GOV.UK Prototype Kit to use the new release (example card: [#923](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit/issues/923))

2. Add the issues to the [Design System sprint board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/4).

3. Write a summary to post on Slack after the release. For example:

    ðŸš€ Weâ€™ve just released GOV.â€ŒUK Frontend v3.7.0. It's now easier and faster to use our Sass. We've also made improvements to back links, breadcrumbs, lists and the header. Thanks to @SLACK-NAME for helping with this release. [https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.7.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.7.0)

    Remember that Prototype Kit needs its own summary, since it has its own release notes.  

4. Ask a technical writer or a content designer to review the summary.

5. Before you proceed to the next section, confirm with the appropriate person that the release notes and any related pull requests are ready to publish. Depending on the issue, the appropriate person may be the technical writer, the content designer, or a developer. If youâ€™re unsure who it is, then ask within the [#govuk-design-system](https://gds.slack.com/archives/CAF8JA25U) Slack channel.

# Steps you must complete to release a new version of GOV.UK Frontend

1. Checkout **master** and pull latest changes.

2. Run `nvm use` to ensure you are using the right version of Node.js and npm.

3. Run `npm install` to ensure you have the latest dependencies installed.

4. Create and checkout a new branch (`release-[version-number]`).
  The version number is determined by looking at the [current "Unreleased" CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md) changes and updating the previous release number depending on the kind of entries:

  - `Breaking changes` corresponds to a `major` (1.X.X) change.
  - `New features` corresponds to a `minor` (X.1.X) change.
  - `Fixes` corresponds to a `patch` (X.X.1) change.

  For example if the previous version is `2.3.0` and there are entries for `Breaking changes` then the new release should be `3.0.0`.

  See the [versioning documentation](versioning.md) for more information.

5. Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) "Unreleased" heading with the new version number. Add a new "Unreleased" heading above this, so people raising new PRs know where to add these to the Changelog.

6. Update [`package/package.json`](../../package/package.json) version with the new version number.

7. Save the changes. Do not commit.

8. Run `npm run build-release`, you will be prompted to continue or cancel.

9. (Optional) Test in [GOV.UK Design System](git@github.com:alphagov/govuk-design-system.git)

  If you want to test your changes work correctly when used in the GOV.UK Design System you can use [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) to test before publishing.

  ```bash
  cd ../govuk-design-system
  git checkout master
  git pull
  npm install # note running `npm install` after `npm link` will destroy the link.
  npm link ../govuk-frontend/package/
  ```

  When you have finished you need to unlink the package

  ```bash
  npm unlink ../govuk-frontend/package/
  ```

10. Create a pull request and copy the changelog text.
   When reviewing the PR, check that the version numbers have been updated and that the compiled assets use this version number.

11. Once the pull request is approved, merge to **master**.

12. Checkout **master** and pull the latest changes.

13. Log into npm (`npm login`), using team [credentials](https://github.com/alphagov/design-system-team-credentials/tree/master/npm/govuk-patterns-and-tools).

14. Run `npm run publish-release`, you will be prompted to continue or cancel.

15. View the created tag in the [Github interface](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases)
  - select the latest tag
  - press 'Edit tag'
  - set "GOV.UK Frontend v[version-number]" as the title
  - add release notes from changelog
  - attach the generated ZIP that has been generated at the root of this project
  - publish release

16. Log out from npm
```bash
npm logout
```
